# Bananaman's Spicy Obsidian 🍌

### Obsidian Views:

- [Next-Tasks GTD](Views/Next-Tasks/README.md)


### How to Download:

- If you are a **normal person**, the easiest method is to simply [download a zip](https://github.com/Bananaman/Spicy-Obsidian/archive/main.zip) of the latest contents and unzip it into your Obsidian vault.
- If you are a **power-user**, you may prefer to clone this repository via `git clone https://github.com/Bananaman/Spicy-Obsidian.git` and then symlink the desired modules into your Obsidian vault. This makes it very easy to retrieve updates. However, updates are unlikely since I take great care to release finished projects. 😉
